# 10bit-potentiometric-DAC-3.3v-analog-voltage-1.8v-digital-voltage-and-1-off-chip-voltage-reference

This work is aimed at design of a 10bit potentiometric DAC with 3.3V analog output volatge and 1.8V digital inputs with a single external reference voltage source. The DAC is designed using multiple stages for better performance and less area requirements compared to a single stage DAC.

## Need for a potentiometric DAC IP

Modern electronic systems dominate due to the evolution in digital technology. However the outside world remains analog in nature. DACs form an important link to connect between the digital systems to the analog world. Binary weighted DAC, R-2R DAC, current steering DAC, resister string DAC are some of the DAC architectures used in various applications. 

## Open source EDA Tools used to develop the IP

The design is done using opensource EDA tools such as eSim for the prelayout simulatioms and MAGIC for the layout and postlayout simulations. eSim is a free and open source EDA tool for circuit design, simulation, analysis and PCB design. It is an integrated tool built using open source software such as KiCad, Ngspice and GHDL. Magic is an opensource VLSI layout tool.
